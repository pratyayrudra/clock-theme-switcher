# Clock Theme Switcher

- #### This is a simple project in which i implemented a toggle to switch between Dark and Light Theme.

- #### For the content part I have used javascript to display the current time and this is updated every second.

- ## To Switch Between Themes : 
  - ### Dark Theme: 🌚 Dark Mode?
  -  ### Light Theme: 🌝 Light Mode?
